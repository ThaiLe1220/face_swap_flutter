### Original Implementation
In the original implementation, when a user uploads an image:

1. **Image Selection**:
   - The user selects an image from the gallery using the `image_picker` package.
   - The selected image is stored in a `File` object in the `_mediaFile` variable.

2. **Display Image**:
   - The selected image is displayed in the app by rendering the `File` object in an `Image.file` widget.

### Persistence Across App Restarts

- **Temporary Storage**:
  - The selected image is temporarily stored in memory (RAM) and is only available during the current session of the app.
  - **When the App is Closed**: If the app is closed or restarted, the `_mediaFile` variable is reset, and the reference to the selected image is lost. This means the uploaded image is not persisted across app restarts.

### Saving Image Locally

In the modified implementation, the `_saveImageLocally` method saves the uploaded image to the local file system of the device. Here's what happens:

1. **Getting the Directory**:
   - The `getApplicationDocumentsDirectory` method from the `path_provider` package retrieves the directory on the device where the app can store files. This directory is private to the app and can be used to store persistent data.
   - For iOS, this would typically be a directory like `/var/mobile/Containers/Data/Application/<AppID>/Documents/`.
   - For Android, it would be a directory like `/data/data/<package_name>/files/`.

2. **Saving the Image**:
   - The `_saveImageLocally` method takes the selected image file, copies it to the documents directory, and returns the new file path.
   - The copied image file is then added to the `_imageFiles` list, allowing it to be displayed and persisted.

### Explanation of Directory

- **Application Documents Directory**:
  - The application documents directory is a private storage area for each app. Files saved here are private to the app and are not accessible by other apps.
  - On an actual device (like an iPhone or an Android phone), this directory is part of the app's sandbox environment.
  - On an emulator, this directory mimics the same structure as on a real device. For macOS, it’s a virtualized environment within the emulator.

### Implications of Local Storage

- **Persistence**:
  - By saving the image to the application's documents directory, the image remains stored even if the app is closed or restarted. The next time the app runs, you can load and display the images from this directory, providing persistence.

- **Storage Location**:
  - This storage is local to the device (or emulator) running the app, not on your macOS development machine.
  - For instance, if you run the app on an iPhone emulator, the images are stored in the emulator's filesystem. If you deploy the app on a physical iPhone, the images are stored on the phone itself.

### Code Example Recap

Here is the relevant part of the code that handles saving the image locally:

```dart
Future<File> _saveImageLocally(File image) async {
  final directory = await getApplicationDocumentsDirectory();
  final String imagePath = path.join(directory.path, path.basename(image.path));
  final File savedImage = await image.copy(imagePath);
  return savedImage;
}
```

- **Retrieve Directory**: `final directory = await getApplicationDocumentsDirectory();`
  - Gets the path to the documents directory on the device.

- **Build Path**: `final String imagePath = path.join(directory.path, path.basename(image.path));`
  - Creates a full path for the image file in the documents directory.

- **Copy File**: `final File savedImage = await image.copy(imagePath);`
  - Copies the selected image file to the new path, effectively saving it in the documents directory.

### Loading Saved Images on App Start

To fully implement persistence, you would need to load any previously saved images when the app starts. This can be done by listing the contents of the documents directory and loading the image files into `_imageFiles` when the app initializes. Here’s a brief example of how to do this:

```dart
@override
void initState() {
  super.initState();
  _loadSavedImages();
}
Future<void> _loadSavedImages() async {
  final directory = await getApplicationDocumentsDirectory();
  final List<FileSystemEntity> files = directory.listSync();
  setState(() {
    _imageFiles.addAll(
      files.whereType<File>().map((file) => File(file.path)).toList(),
    );
  });
}
```

This `initState` method will load saved images from the documents directory when the app starts, making them available in the `_imageFiles` list for display.
